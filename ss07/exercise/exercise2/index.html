                    <b>Mr. Bean</b> is a British sitcom created by Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis, produced by Tiger
                    Aspect
                    and starring Atkinson as the eponymous title character. The sitcom consists of 15 episodes that were
                    co-written by Atkinson alongside Curtis and Robin Driscoll; for the pilot, it was co-written by Ben
                    Elton. The series was originally broadcast on ITV, beginning with the pilot on 1 January 1990 and
                    ending with "The Best Bits of Mr. Bean" on 15 December 1995.
                    Based on a character developed by Atkinson while he was studying for his master's degree at the
                    University of Oxford, the series centres on Mr. Bean, described by Atkinson as "a child in a grown
                    man's body", as he solves various problems presented by everyday tasks and often causes disruption
                    in the process. The series has been influenced by physical comedy actors such as Jacques Tati and
                    those from early silent films.

                    During its original five-year run, Mr. Bean was met with widespread acclaim and attracted large
                    television audiences. The series was viewed by 18.74 million viewers for the episode "The Trouble
                    with Mr. Bean" and has received a number of international awards, including the Rose d'Or. The
                    series has since been sold in 245 territories worldwide. It has inspired an animated spin-off and
                    two theatrical feature-length films along with Atkinson reprising his role as Mr. Bean for a
                    performance at the London 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, television commercials and several
                    sketches for Comic Relief. The programme carries strong appeal in hundreds of territories worldwide
                    because, in addition to the acclaim from its original run, it uses very little intelligible
                    dialogue, making it accessible to people who know little or no English.
